                <p><strong>FSCD 2021: Fifth International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction</strong><br>
                    July 17 -- July 24,  2021, Buenos Aires, Argentina<br>

                <p>FSCD 2021 will be the sixth edition of the International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic situation, the 2021 edition of FSCD and its satellite workshops will be held online.</p>
                <p>We invite proposals for workshops, tutorials or other satellite events, on any topic related to formal structures in computation, deduction and automated reasoning, from theoretical foundations to tools and applications.</p>
                <p>Satellite events will take place online on the 17-18 and 23-24 July, before and after the main conference (19-22 July). It is expected that satellite events would run for 1 or 2 days, and be open to participants of parallel events.</p>

                <h3>PROPOSALS:</h3>
                <p>Proposals must be limited to three pages and should be submitted via EasyChair
                    <center><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2021</a> (Workshops track)</center></p>
                Each proposal should consist of the following two parts:
                <ol>
                    <li>A description part including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list of previous or related workshops (if relevant);</li>
                            <li>a brief description (up to 120 words) of the event for the website and publicity material.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>An organisational part including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>contact information for the workshop organisers;</li>
                            <li>name of the organiser in the role of FSCD Workshops Scheduling Committee member (*);</li>
                            <li>estimate of the number of workshop participants;</li>
                            <li>proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.);</li>
                            <li>potential invited speakers;</li>
                            <li>procedures for selecting papers and participants;</li>
                            <li>tentative schedule for paper submission and notification of acceptance;</li>
                            <li>plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);</li>
                            <li>duration (which may vary from one day to two days);</li>
                            <li>preferred period (pre, or post main conference);</li>
                            <li>any other special requirements.</li>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>(*) The FSCD Workshops Scheduling Committee will include one of the organisers of each accepted workshop and have the role to concoct a scientifically coherent program of all workshops mitigating superpositions of connected talks. This organisational effort will require that each workshop finalise their selection of talks and invited speakers within a common pertinent deadline to be defined so that possible overlaps can be minimised. Please, consider this when preparing the tentative schedule of your workshop proposal.</p>
                <p>The Organising Committee of FSCD will determine the final list of accepted workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs and availability of space and facilities.</p>
                <p>The organisers of satellite events are expected to create and maintain a website for the event; handle paper selection, reviewing and acceptance; draw up a tentative programme of talks; advertise their event though specialist mailing lists; prepare the informal pre-proceedings (if applicable) in a timely fashion; and arrange any post-proceedings. Some amount of financial support may be offered to workshops, depending on the number of participants.</p>
                <p>The FSCD Organising Committee will handle promotion of the event on the main conference website; integration of the event's programme into the overall timetable; registration of participants; arrangement of an appropriate virtual meeting room and technical support will be provided by the FSCD organising committee.</p>
